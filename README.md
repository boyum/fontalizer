# ðŸŒŸ electron fontalizer ðŸŒŸ
Lo and behold! You are now about to witness what soon will be dubbed no less than the text editor of the century. Check out the demo and be amazed. You are very welcome.

## The greatest editor of all time
No longer will you have to use your mouse when what you really want to do is to have every hand on the keyboard, producing great [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article), [subtitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)) for [B movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie), heck you sure could even code your own programs in this little thing! 

Forget about aching right arms or remembering obscure four-step combination hotkeys, and start using the fontalizer now! In one single keypress, you can choose between a variety of sizes, colors, and even rotations! It has never been easier to make each character stand out!

This is only an electron wrapper around the marvelous [original fontalizer](https://github.com/Avexis/fontalizer).
